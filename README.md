## CS308: Machine Learning Project | Stock Market Predictor

1) **Problem definition:** Predict stock prices of a company using conventional stock features and social media sentiment.
2) **Motivation:** Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do due to the high volatility of stock prices.
3) **Method used:** Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model used on a total of 58 features (50 word2vec embeddings, 6 conventional features from stock market, and 2 sentiment features).
4) **Results obtained:**
- The final model is compared to a baseline model which uses only 6 features (conventional stock market values).
- The error is much lower and although the number of EPOCHS needed increases.
- It is also compared to another model having 8 features, i.e., a model without Word2Vec embeddings.
- The plots of absolute errors is shown.
